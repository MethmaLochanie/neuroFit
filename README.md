# NeuroFit

NeuroFit is a full-stack application that combines machine learning capabilities with a modern web interface for neurological fitness assessment and analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

### 1. Client (Frontend)
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses modern UI libraries including Ant Design and PrimeReact
- Features:
  - Redux for state management
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for API communication
  - Modern UI components and icons

### 2. Server (Backend)
- Node.js/Express.js backend
- MongoDB database integration
- Features:
  - JWT authentication
  - Azure Blob Storage integration
  - File upload handling with Multer
  - CORS support
  - Secure password handling with bcrypt

### 3. ML-API (Machine Learning Service)
- Python-based machine learning service
- Features:
  - PyTorch for deep learning
  - Transformers library integration
  - Torch Geometric for graph neural networks
  - Flask web framework
  - Model training and inference capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB
- Azure Storage Account (for file storage)

## Installation

### Client Setup
```bash
cd Client
npm install
